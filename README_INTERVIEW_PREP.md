## How to Use This Material Effectively

### ✅ Do This:
1. **Practice out loud** — Don't just read these answers. Say them aloud 3-5 times so they sound natural
2. **Customize for role** — Adjust examples to emphasize what that role cares about (e.g., leadership examples for leadership role)
3. **Mix and match** — These files complement each other. Use CHEATSHEET for quick reference, GUIDE for practice, CASE_STUDY for deep dives
4. **Update with feedback** — After each interview, add notes about what worked (keep iterating)
5. **Practice under pressure** — Record yourself answering questions, or do mock interviews with friends

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Don't memorize word-for-word** — Sounds robotic and inflexible
2. **Don't use all files for every interview** — Phone screen needs CHEATSHEET, not ARCHITECTURE_CASE_STUDY
3. **Don't focus on answers only** — Understanding trade-offs and reasoning is what makes answers land
4. **Don't ignore body language** — Confidence in delivery matters (see BEHAVIORAL_INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md tips)
5. **Don't forget to ask questions** — Interviews are two-way; show genuine interest

## Quick Troubleshooting

**Q: "I'm nervous and forgetting everything"**
A: That's normal. Review INTERVIEW_CHEATSHEET.txt (5 min), then focus on deep breathing. You know this material.

**Q: "They asked something not in these materials"**
A: Great—use your STAR framework and be honest. These are templates, not scripts. Authenticity > perfection.

A: 90% manual work reduction and 94% payroll error reduction are real, measurable business outcomes. That IS impressive. Own it.

**Q: "How do I make this relevant to their specific role?"**
A: Read the job description, identify their 3 biggest challenges, then customize stories to address them. (e.g., if role is about "scale," emphasize 50-repo story; if role is "leadership," emphasize standards-setting story)

**Q: "I feel like I'm overselling myself"**
A: You're not. You have data to back everything up. Confidence is just communicating your truth.
