═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                          CORE INTERVIEW STORIES (2 MAIN PROJECTS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROJECT 1: TIMEKEEPING INTEGRATION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE PROBLEM:
• Field workers had to manually reconcile time between mobile app & legacy system
• Payroll errors: 5-8% of entries causing customer disputes
• No real-time sync between clock-in/out and permanent time records
• 500+ manual hours/month spent on reconciliation
• Compliance/audit issues with location tracking

THE SOLUTION:
Event-driven architecture spanning 3 layers:
  1. MOBILE LAYER (React Native)
     • Built shift timer UI with real-time display
     • Capture device properties (iOS vs Android, app version) for debugging
     • "Continue shift" feature to reduce worker friction after breaks
     
  2. API LAYER (Node.js)
     • Shift state machine (STARTED → BREAK → RESUMED → ENDED)
     • Endpoints: clock-in/out, breaks, location validation
     • Tenant mapping for multi-tenant deployments
     
  3. SERVERLESS LAYER (AWS Lambda + SQS) — MY MAIN FOCUS
     • SQS queue captures shift events from mobile
     • Lambda consumer processes events in real-time
     • Timegate+ transformation for time & attendance platform
     • Syncs with legacy systems
     • Device properties tracking for production debugging
     • Fixed: TbWW consumer sorting, Timegate override handling, API calls

RESULTS:
• 90% reduction in manual time reconciliation (500 → <50 hours/month)
• 94% reduction in payroll errors (5-8% → <0.5%)
• 18x faster issue resolution (<4 hours vs 2-3 days before)
• 25+ PRs merged (79.8% merge rate on serverless)
• 1200+ lines of code across event pipeline, state machine, integrations

SOUNDBITE #1:
"When I first looked at timekeeping, field workers were manually reconciling 
between 5-8 different systems. I designed an event-driven architecture that automated 
the entire pipeline. The result: 90% less manual work and 94% fewer payroll errors—
that's not just code quality, that's operational transformation."

TECHNICAL DECISIONS I'D DISCUSS:
• Event-driven vs Synchronous: Why eventual consistency (100-500ms) is fine for payroll
• Device properties: How tracking iOS vs Android versions caught production bugs
• State machine validation: Handling emergency end-shift edge cases
• Tenant mapping: Multi-tenant isolation with API keys

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROJECT 2: ISSUES FROM AUDITS (IFA) SYSTEM
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE PROBLEM:
• Field supervisors conduct audits but findings didn't convert to tracked issues
• 40% of audit findings manually created as issues (slow, error-prone)
• No structured follow-up process or compliance tracking
• Issues created manually were often incomplete, delayed, or forgotten
• No audit trail connecting findings → issues → resolution

THE SOLUTION:
Full-stack system: Schema design + Web UI + API + Serverless automation

  1. SCHEMA DESIGN (MongoDB)
     • audit_followups collection with issueId linking
     • Track status: open/closed/errored for failed auto-creations
     • Store photo/comment requirements for compliance
     • Template ID tracking for reporting
     
  2. WEB UI (React)
     • Audit view showing all auto-created issues
     • Reports dashboard for follow-up tracking
     • Batch update interface (bulk status/assignee changes)
     • Photo/comment requirement validation
     • Fixed: field mapping issues, cache invalidation, scrolling performance
     
  3. API LAYER (Node.js)
     • Endpoints: create/update follow-ups, batch operations, issue linking
     • CSV export for compliance teams
     • Cloudfront signed URLs for audit photos
     • Notification system (tasks, issues, audits)
     
  4. SERVERLESS AUTOMATION (Lambda)
     • Triggered on audit completion
     • Auto-creates issues from findings (no manual step)
     • 95% creation success rate
     • Errored follow-ups visible to support for escalation

RESULTS:
• 95% auto-creation rate (vs 40% manual before)
• 62% faster issue resolution (5-7 → 2-3 days avg)
• 100% structured follow-up tracking (was 0% before)
• 67% efficiency gain for supervisors (30 → 10 min per audit)
• 44 PRs merged across schema, web, API

SOUNDBITE #2:
"The audit system at Lighthouse wasn't broken—it was manual. Supervisors had all 
the data they needed, but findings lived in spreadsheets instead of issues. I automated 
the entire workflow: audit → auto-create issue → track resolution. 95% of findings 
now get tracked, and supervisors save 20 hours/month on data entry."

TECHNICAL DECISIONS I'D DISCUSS:
• Auto-creation with manual override: Why you need both
• Error handling: How errored status prevents silent failures
• Schema design: Linking follow-ups to multiple issues (1-to-many)
• Batch operations: How Gherkin tests validated partial failure scenarios

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PROJECT 3: INFRASTRUCTURE & DEVOPS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
APPRUNNER MIGRATION + GITHUB ACTIONS CI/CD:
• Migrated API from Elastic Beanstalk to AppRunner, simplifying infrastructure
• Rebuilt entire CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions (replacing previous DevOps setup)
• Implemented automated testing, security scanning, blue-green deployments
• Results: Faster iterations, improved reliability, standardized workflows

CLOUDFRONT SIGNED URLS + EDGE LAMBDA TRANSFORMATIONS:
• Implemented secure image serving with CloudFront signed URLs
• Built Lambda@Edge transformations for dynamic image resizing at CDN edge
• Moving from direct bucket links to intelligent caching + transformation layer
• Expected benefits: 60%+ reduction in origin load, faster media delivery

SOUNDBITE #3:
"I don't just focus on application features—I also invest in developer experience 
and infrastructure. Migrated our API to AppRunner, rebuilt CI/CD in GitHub Actions 
for faster deployments, and now implementing edge Lambda transformations for secure, 
efficient image serving. Infrastructure decisions directly impact feature velocity."

Q: "Tell me about yourself"
→ Use the 30-second pitch above, then: "My background is solving operational 
  problems through technology. I'm most energized by projects with measurable 
  impact—not vanity metrics, but real business outcomes. What would you like to 
  know more about?"

Q: "What's your greatest strength?"
→ "End-to-end problem solving across the full stack. I don't just code features—
  I understand the workflow, design solutions that fit how people actually work, 
  and measure whether they're working. Built timekeeping system that reduced 
  manual work 90% and audit system that's now handling 95% auto-creation. Both 
  shipped to production and scaled."

Q: "Describe your most complex project"
→ "Either timekeeping integration or audit system (they pick). Use the soundbites 
  above, emphasizing: complexity (cross-platform coordination), constraints 
  (legacy system integration), and impact (reduced payroll errors, scaled 
  operational efficiency)."

Q: "Tell me about a time you failed / made mistakes"
→ "Early in the timekeeping project, I over-engineered the event schema trying 
  to capture every possible device state. It worked but was fragile. When we hit 
  a production bug on iOS devices, it took hours to debug because of unnecessary 
  complexity. Learned: simple, explicit contracts beat clever architectures. Now 
  I start with 'what's the minimal data we need' instead of 'what might we need 
  someday.'"

Q: "Why are you leaving / interested in this role?"
→ "I've built deeply at Lighthouse-io and solved complex problems. I'm looking 
  for the next challenge where I can apply these skills to a new domain—whether 
  that's new technology, new team structure, or new type of problem. [Specific]: 
  Your need for [scalable systems / operational efficiency / full-stack thinking] 
  is exactly where I thrive."

Q: "Describe a technical decision and the trade-offs"
→ "Event-driven vs synchronous timekeeping. Event-driven won because: 
  (1) Payroll doesn't need <50ms response, (2) eventual consistency OK within 
  seconds, (3) gives us resilience and DLQ for debugging. Synchronous would've 
  meant data loss on network failures. The trade-off: 100-500ms latency for 
  guaranteed delivery. Worth it for a financial system."

Q: "What's your leadership style?"
→ "I believe leadership is creating systems that let good work scale. At 
  Lighthouse, I didn't need to tell people to use timekeeping correctly—the 
  system made it the obvious choice. For audit issues, supervisors didn't need 
  management—95% automation just worked. Leadership through design, not authority."

Q: "What technologies do you work with?"
→ Highlight: React Native (mobile), Node.js (API), AWS Lambda/SQS (serverless), 
  MongoDB (schemas), React (web UI), CSS, Docker, Git. Depth: "I'm most 
  comfortable in full-stack JavaScript/Node ecosystem, but I learn new tech fast 
  when it solves problems. Most important: understand the system end-to-end."

Q: "Tell me about a time you improved processes"
→ "Audit system is the best example. Process was: audit happens → supervisor 
  manually creates issues → compliance team tracks follow-ups. Three teams, lots 
  of manual work, compliance gaps. I mapped the whole workflow, identified that 
  95% of findings were deterministic (could be auto-created), designed schema 
  that captured what supervisors needed, and automated it. Supervisor time per 
  audit dropped 67% (30 → 10 min)."

                              QUESTIONS TO ASK THEM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

(Near end of interview, before they ask about next steps)

STRONG SIGNAL QUESTIONS:
• "How do you measure success for engineering teams? What metrics matter most?"
  → Your work is 90% reduction in manual labor, 94% error reduction—real metrics.
    If they say "velocity" or "story points," dig deeper on quality.

• "Tell me about your biggest operational challenge right now."
  → Listen for: scaling across teams, system reliability, cross-platform 
    coordination. These are your wheelhouse (you've solved all three).

• "How do teams coordinate when changes affect multiple services?"
  → You've done this with timekeeping (mobile → API → serverless) and audit 
    (web → API → Lambda). Show that you understand the complexity.

CULTURE FIT QUESTIONS:
• "What do you look for in engineers you want to work with?"
  → Listen for: systems thinking, ownership, shipping mindset. You demonstrate all three.

• "Tell me about your last mistake and how you handled it."
  → Good leaders admit mistakes and learn. Shows psychological safety exists.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                               CLOSING THOUGHTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOUR UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:
You're not a specialist in one tech—you're a full-stack builder who ships systems 
that have real operational impact. You've reduced manual work 90%, cut payroll 
errors 94%, and automated compliance workflows. You understand the full journey 
from mobile app through serverless to permanent records.

REMEMBER:
• If they only care about coding speed, they might not value your approach
• Your metrics (90% manual work reduction, 94% error reduction) are rare—own them
• You know this stuff backward and forward—confidence is your friend
• Tell the truth with specifics (dates, numbers, technologies)

FINAL PHRASE (if you sense hesitation):
"I understand there are many candidates. Here's what differentiates me: I don't 
just write code—I understand workflows, design systems that fit reality, and 
measure whether they're working. My timekeeping system reduced manual labor 90% 
and cut payroll errors 94%. My audit system is handling 95% of findings 
automatically. That's not accident—that's systems thinking applied to real 
operational problems."
